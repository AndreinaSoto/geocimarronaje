## Welcome to Geocimarronaje
GeoCimarronaje, seeks to address the need to recover the spatial histories of maroon communities. We are building a prototype, based on a relational database and a series of digital maps, that can serve as a model to reconstruct the geographic trajectories of cimarronaje across the greater Caribbean. Our study spans 1520 to 1804 and focuses primarily on regions under Spanish colonial rule during that period, which aligns with our research expertise.
